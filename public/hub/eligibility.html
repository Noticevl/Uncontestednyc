<section class="section"><div class="container"><h1 class="title">Eligibility — the quick version</h1><p class='p'>You qualify for an uncontested divorce if: (1) you both agree to end the marriage, (2) you agree on the terms (money, property, and—if you have kids—custody/support), and (3) New York has a connection to your case.</p><p class='p'>New York’s “connection” rules are flexible. For many people, one spouse living in NY for the last two years is enough. One year can also work if you married here or the reason for divorce happened here.</p><p class='p'>If you’re not sure, we’ll sort it out on a quick call. We’ll never file unless the clerk can accept it.</p></div></section>
