<div class='accordion'>
<details><summary>What exactly is a “truly uncontested” divorce?</summary><div>It means there are no live disputes—property, spousal support, parenting time/custody, and child support are all resolved—and the other spouse cooperates by signing the papers or does not appear after proper service. The case proceeds largely on written submissions, which is why accuracy and judge‑friendly presentation matter.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to appear in court?</summary><div>Most uncontested divorces in NYC are decided on papers. A judge can ask for clarification or a brief appearance, but that’s the exception, not the rule. We handle the filings and keep you ready if anything is requested.</div></details>
<details><summary>What residency rules apply (DRL §230)?</summary><div>You must satisfy one of New York’s residency paths—most commonly two years immediately before filing, or one year plus a New York tie like being married in NY, living together in NY as spouses, or grounds that arose in NY. We confirm which paragraph of §230 fits your facts and reflect it in the pleadings.</div></details>
<details><summary>Which grounds do you use (DRL §170)?</summary><div>Nearly all uncontested cases use §170(7), “irretrievable breakdown” for at least six months. It avoids proof of fault and keeps the focus on paperwork completeness and timelines.</div></details>
<details><summary>How long does an uncontested case take?</summary><div>Timelines vary by county and calendar, but many cases finalize a few months after the signed packet is filed. Our role is to move promptly, submit a clean packet, and respond quickly to any clerk or chambers request.</div></details>
<details><summary>What’s included in the $5,000 all‑in fee?</summary><div>Attorney time, standard statewide filing fees (Index Number, RJI, Note of Issue), and routine NYC personal service. That’s the predictable core of an uncontested case. If anything non‑standard pops up, you’ll get a clear quote first.</div></details>
<details><summary>What costs are not standard?</summary><div>Publication or other alternate service, international service, translations, extra certified copies, apostilles, deeds, and QDROs. These are uncommon in truly uncontested matters; if needed, we discuss options and pricing before moving forward.</div></details>
<details><summary>How does personal service work (CPLR 308)?</summary><div>Default is personal delivery to your spouse by a process server. If personal service proves impracticable, we can seek court‑approved alternate service. Proofs of service and timing rules matter; we track them tightly to avoid delays.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can we e‑file (NYSCEF)?</summary><div>Matrimonial e‑filing is generally by consent. Where it’s available and appropriate, we use NYSCEF. Otherwise we use EDDS or paper filing as directed. Note: EDDS submissions are treated as filed when the clerk accepts them.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do we need a separation or settlement agreement?</summary><div>Not always, but it’s often helpful to capture property/support/parenting terms with clarity banks and agencies will honor. For simple cases, the uncontested packet may suffice; for others, a short, plain‑English agreement avoids confusion later.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we have children—does it complicate an uncontested divorce?</summary><div>It adds required elements, not chaos. We include CSSA‑compliant child support terms (or a valid opt‑out with required explanations) and clear parenting provisions. Some counties require a UCS‑111 summary; we prepare what your judge expects.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can the Judgment restore a former surname?</summary><div>Yes. The Judgment can authorize resuming a premarriage or other former surname. If you want this option, we include the language so you can update IDs and records smoothly.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can court fees be waived if I can’t afford them?</summary><div>Possibly. Courts can waive filing fees upon proper motion for poor person relief. If finances are tight, we’ll discuss whether it fits and how to apply.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if my spouse won’t sign?</summary><div>A case can still be uncontested if your spouse doesn’t appear after valid service. We plan service carefully and submit the default papers required for a judgment without an appearance.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do you use remote online notarization (RON)?</summary><div>Yes, when appropriate under New York’s rules. RON requires identity proofing and an audio‑video record. We’ll advise whether in‑person or remote notarization makes more sense for your documents.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to disclose everything about assets and debts?</summary><div>Uncontested doesn’t mean casual. Your paperwork is sworn. If there’s property, support, or debt allocation, we draft with specificity and consistency so the record is enforceable and clear to third parties like banks and title offices.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I keep my address private?</summary><div>We can discuss privacy measures such as using a mailing address or requesting confidentiality in appropriate circumstances. Safety and service rules still have to be followed; we’ll align with court requirements while respecting your privacy.</div></details>
<details><summary>What happens after the judge signs?</summary><div>We guide you through obtaining certified copies, then updating SSA, DMV, passports, bank/beneficiary records, titles, and insurance. If your Judgment includes a name‑change clause, bring a certified copy to those offices.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if I later need changes to custody or support?</summary><div>Post‑judgment modifications are possible with proper grounds and procedures. That’s different from the uncontested pathway, but we can talk through realistic options if circumstances change.</div></details>
<details><summary>Is everything truly flat‑fee?</summary><div>Yes for the core uncontested path as described. If something materially expands scope (e.g., international service, extensive revisions), we’ll quote the delta in advance so you stay in control of cost.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can we go faster?</summary><div>We move quickly on drafting and filing. Court calendars are the true gatekeeper. Submitting a clean, judge‑ready packet is the best way to avoid rework and keep things moving.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I start even if a couple of details aren’t fully decided?</summary><div>Yes—if both spouses are aligned in principle. We’ll map the decisions you still need and keep the file moving so momentum doesn’t die while you finalize terms.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if my spouse lives out of state or abroad?</summary><div>Service rules change but the case can still be uncontested. We’ll plan service compliant with the destination’s requirements (e.g., Hague Service Convention) or pursue alternate service by court order when appropriate.</div></details>
<details><summary>Will I speak with a real attorney or a chatbot?</summary><div>A real attorney. You’ll get plain‑English answers and clear next steps. The tools on this site are for education and convenience; the legal work is attorney‑led.</div></details>
<details><summary>How do refunds before each stage work?</summary><div>You can cancel before work begins on a stage. Stage 1 is earned when we start drafting strategy documents; Stage 2 when we start drafting forms/agreements; Stage 3 when filing or service begins. We spell this out in the retainer so there are no surprises.</div></details>
