  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
  <div class="accordion">
    <details class="details"><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">In most uncontested divorces, no personal appearance is required. We handle e‑filing where accepted and EDDS where directed. If a judge asks for a clarification, we address it in writing whenever possible.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>How long does this take?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Many uncontested NYC cases finish 8–16 weeks after both spouses sign. Timing ultimately depends on clerk workloads in your borough and whether any special steps (like international service) are needed.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard New York filing fees, and routine NYC personal service. If your matter needs unusual steps—publication, international service, translation—we’ll explain them plainly and show any out‑of‑pocket cost before you choose.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Yes. Work is split into three stages. A refund is available before substantive work in Stage 1, before filing/service in Stage 2, and before judgment submissions in Stage 3.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Not necessarily. New York’s residency statute offers several paths, including one spouse in NY for two years, or one year with ties to NY (e.g., marriage occurred here). We’ll map your facts to a qualifying path at intake.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Both spouses agree to divorce and to all major terms: property, debts, parenting schedule and decision‑making, child support and add‑ons, and any name change.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">We use NYSCEF wherever accepted and EDDS where directed. You’ll receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">You’ll need a workable parenting plan and child support terms. We draft in plain English with the clarity clerks expect—holidays, travel, decision‑making, and communication spelled out.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">New York’s CSSA applies a percentage to combined parental income and accounts for add‑ons like healthcare, childcare, and extracurriculars. We’ll run the math and include the required worksheets.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Yes, you can list a suitable mailing address; the court primarily needs a reliable address for service and notices. We explain options at intake.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Yes. If requested, the Judgment will restore your former name so you can update records with a single court document.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">We handle service by the simplest lawful method, including international conventions if needed. We’ll explain time and cost up front.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What if things become contested mid‑way?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">If a dispute arises, we’ll discuss options and any change in scope before work continues. You stay in control.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">No. Many couples reach agreement directly. If you want a neutral to help finalize terms, we can point you to reputable mediators.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">No. Several residency paths satisfy the statute even if only one spouse lives in NY or the marriage took place here.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">It’s rare in uncontested matters. If a judge needs a clarification, it usually arrives as a written note through the clerk.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">We use standard notarization and, where permitted, remote online notarization. We’ll confirm what’s acceptable for your documents.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Yes—clarity helps everyone. We draft them to be practical and child‑focused, so they pass review.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What about retirement accounts?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">If there’s a transfer (e.g., a portion of a 401(k)), we’ll outline whether a QDRO is needed and when it’s prepared.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Uncontested matters generally use simple sworn statements rather than contested‑case discovery. We’ll provide the exact forms you need.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Your plan includes the standard NY filing fees; if a rare outside fee applies (publication, international service), we’ll show it up front before you choose.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Most signatures are accepted electronically; some documents still require ink signatures. We provide plain‑English instructions so nothing is rejected.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">We’ll sequence drafting and filing to avoid back‑and‑forth and give you a realistic range on day one. You’ll get updates at meaningful points.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>What if we already separated years ago?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">That’s fine. We’ll line up the timeline and make sure your papers reflect your actual separation history.</div></details><details class="details"><summary>Will this affect immigration?</summary><div style="margin-top:8px">Divorce can affect immigration status and sponsorship obligations. If that’s relevant, we’ll flag it and coordinate with an immigration attorney if needed.</div></details>
