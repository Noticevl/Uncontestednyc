<h1 class="section-title">Frequently asked questions</h1>
<p class="lede">Short answers up front; expand for detail.</p>
<div style="max-width:900px">
<details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><p>No—most uncontested cases are decided on the papers. If a judge requires a clarification, we handle it and explain what’s needed.</p></details>
<details><summary>How long does this take?</summary><p>Many matters complete in 8–16 weeks after both spouses sign. Timing varies by borough workload and completeness of the packet.</p></details>
<details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><p>Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard NYC filing fees (Index Number and equivalents), routine personal service, two rounds of revisions, and a document archive.</p></details>
<details><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><p>Yes. Stage‑based refunds: Stage 1 before drafting starts; Stage 2 before filing occurs; Stage 3 before judgment work begins.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><p>Not necessarily. NY’s residency statute allows several paths. Example: one spouse living in NY for two years; or one year with NY ties. We’ll map facts to the rule.</p></details>
<details><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><p>Both spouses agree on every material term—property, accounts/debts, parenting if any, support, and name change. If issues remain, we’ll suggest options.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><p>We use NYSCEF wherever accepted and EDDS where directed. You receive confirmations and a clean record of everything submitted.</p></details>
<details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><p>NY’s CSSA applies percentages to combined parental income, with caps and add‑ons. We provide the math and worksheets with your documents.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><p>Yes—use “by appointment” and a mailing address that reaches you. We redact apartment numbers unless a court requires disclosure.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I sign electronically?</summary><p>Where rules allow, we use e‑sign plus notarization solutions; otherwise we coordinate convenient in‑person signing.</p></details>
