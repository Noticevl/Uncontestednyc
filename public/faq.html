<main class="container"><h1 class="h1">Frequently asked questions</h1><div class="accordion"><details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class="lede">Uncontested divorces are typically paper‑only. We handle clerk questions and status checks so you don’t have to appear.</div></details>
<details><summary>How long does it take?</summary><div class="lede">Many cases complete 8–16 weeks after signatures. Timing varies by borough workload and judge review practices.</div></details>
<details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div class="lede">Attorney time through Judgment, standard NYC filing fees, routine personal service, and two revision rounds—no surprise add‑ons.</div></details>
<details><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div class="lede">Yes. Stage 1 refund before drafting work is done; Stage 2 refund before filing occurs; Stage 3 refund before judgment work begins.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><div class="lede">No. DRL §230 provides several residency paths; we confirm which applies at intake.</div></details>
<details><summary>What counts as uncontested?</summary><div class="lede">Both spouses agree on all issues and cooperate with signatures and service.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div class="lede">Often. We use NYSCEF where permitted and EDDS where directed. You’ll receive stamped confirmations.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class="lede">We include a clear, workable parenting plan and New York’s required child‑support forms.</div></details>
<details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class="lede">Under the CSSA using combined parental income and statutory percentages, plus add‑ons.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div class="lede">Yes—there are options for confidentiality in sensitive cases; we’ll explain at intake.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div class="lede">Yes—include it now so your Judgment acts as proof for agencies.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</summary><div class="lede">We handle international and out‑of‑state service consistent with NY rules.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><div class="lede">We can include terms within the Judgment package or incorporate an agreement you already signed.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if things become contested mid‑way?</summary><div class="lede">If a dispute arises we’ll outline options, timelines, and costs before any new work proceeds.</div></details>
<details><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><div class="lede">No, but it can help if a few terms need discussion. Neutral referrals available.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><div class="lede">You need to meet one of NY’s residency paths; living in NYC is common but not required.</div></details>
<details><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><div class="lede">It’s uncommon. If clarification is needed, we handle communications.</div></details>
<details><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><div class="lede">We show exactly which pages need a notary and provide mobile/online options.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</summary><div class="lede">Yes, provided they’re clear and workable for day‑to‑day life.</div></details>
<details><summary>What about retirement accounts?</summary><div class="lede">We flag when a separate QDRO is needed and explain the next step.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><div class="lede">Streamlined financial info is typical for uncontested matters unless a clerk requests more.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I sign electronically?</summary><div class="lede">Frequently yes; we’ll specify where wet signatures are still required.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><div class="lede">We file promptly and track closely; some boroughs can move faster than others.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we separated years ago?</summary><div class="lede">Still fine if a residency path applies and terms are settled.</div></details>
<details><summary>Will this affect immigration?</summary><div class="lede">We can coordinate with immigration counsel regarding documents and timing.</div></details></div></main>
