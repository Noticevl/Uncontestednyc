<section class="section"><h1 class="h1">FAQ</h1><div class="faq">
<details class="qa"><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class="small">Most uncontested matters in NYC are resolved entirely by e‑file/EDDS and mail. Appearance is uncommon; if required, we’ll prepare you and explain why.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>How long does this take?</summary><div class="small">Expect 8–16 weeks after signatures. Timing varies by borough workload and whether your case needs special steps like publication or international service.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div class="small">Attorney time through Judgment, standard filing fees (Index Number and Note‑of‑Issue equivalents), and routine personal service. Two revision rounds. Clear engagement letter.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div class="small">Yes. Stage 1 refund before drafting begins; Stage 2 refund before filing/service; Stage 3 refund before judgment submissions begin.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What counts as ‘uncontested’?</summary><div class="small">Both spouses agree to divorce and to all terms (property, debt, parenting, support). No one is asking the court to decide disputed issues.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div class="small">We use NYSCEF when available and EDDS where directed. You’ll receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><div class="small">If your terms go beyond the standard forms, we’ll prepare a stipulation or agreement that sets out the deal in plain English and satisfies the court’s requirements.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Do both of us have to live in NY?</summary><div class="small">No. Residency can be met in several ways—for example, one spouse living in NY for two continuous years before filing; or one year with the marriage taking place in NY or the cause arising here.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class="small">Your plan must be workable and specific. We write plainly: where the child lives, parenting schedule, decision‑making, holidays, travel, and communication.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class="small">New York’s CSSA formula starts with combined parental income, applies a percentage based on number of children, plus add‑ons. We’ll run the math and include required worksheets.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div class="small">Yes, including using a business address for mail and redacting apartment numbers where appropriate.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div class="small">Yes. Include it in the pleadings and Judgment to create a single, permanent record.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What if things become contested mid‑way?</summary><div class="small">We’ll discuss options. If the case becomes contested, we can refer you to counsel who handle litigation, and we’ll provide your file cleanly.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><div class="small">It isn’t required for an uncontested case. If you’re still negotiating, private mediation can be helpful; we can point you to reputable providers.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><div class="small">We use in‑person or remote online notarization (RON) when permitted. You’ll receive instructions with each draft.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Can we customize provisions?</summary><div class="small">Yes—particularly parenting details, communication norms, and property logistics. We keep terms concrete to reduce clerk questions.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><div class="small">We provide the forms the court expects, and any additional affidavits if requested by a clerk based on your facts.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><div class="small">Standard fees (Index Number, Note‑of‑Issue equivalents) are included in the $5,000 plan. Borough‑specific add‑ons are explained up front if triggered.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><div class="small">We handle e‑sign and e‑file steps where permitted, and provide clear directions where wet ink is required.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What if I need Judgment fast?</summary><div class="small">We’ll sequence drafting, signatures, and filing quickly. Final timing depends on clerk review queues in your borough.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>What if we already separated years ago?</summary><div class="small">That’s fine. We’ll confirm residency and uncontested terms, then move forward.</div></details>
<details class="qa"><summary>Will this affect immigration?</summary><div class="small">Divorce can intersect with immigration in specific ways. We can refer you to an immigration attorney for tailored advice if needed.</div></details>
