  <h1 class="h1">Frequently asked questions</h1>
  <div class="faq">
<details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Usually no. Most uncontested matters are handled on papers. If a clerk requests a minor fix, we handle it in writing.</div></details>
<details><summary>How long does this take?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Many cases complete 8–16 weeks after signatures. Timing varies by borough workload and how quickly you return documents.</div></details>
<details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Attorney time through Judgment, standard NYC filing fees (Index Number, Note of Issue equivalents), and routine personal service. Unusual items (publication, translations, international service) are quoted up front.</div></details>
<details><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Yes—this practice uses staged work. Refunds are available before drafting begins (Stage 1), before filing occurs (Stage 2), and before judgment work begins (Stage 3).</div></details>
<details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Not necessarily. DRL §230 has several residency paths (e.g., one spouse in NY for 2 years; or 1 year with ties). We’ll map your facts at intake.</div></details>
<details><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Both spouses agree on all terms (parenting, support, property, debt, name change). There’s no dispute for the judge to decide.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">We use NYSCEF where allowed or EDDS when directed. When a court requires paper filing, we handle that instead.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Your parenting plan must be workable and clear. We cover living arrangements, a schedule, decision‑making, holidays, travel, and communication.</div></details>
<details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">New York’s CSSA uses combined parental income and applies statutory percentages. We run the math and include required add‑ons.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">We can list a mailing address and keep your apartment number private where appropriate. We’ll discuss options at intake.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Yes. We include it in the pleadings and Judgment so you have one permanent document for agencies and accounts.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">No, but a qualifying New York residency path must apply. We’ll confirm which one fits your facts.</div></details>
<details><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Highly unlikely in an uncontested matter. Most communication is through filings and clerk review.</div></details>
<details><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">We’ll explain in‑person vs. remote options (RON) and line up what’s needed for your signatures.</div></details>
<details><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">If requested by the court or for clarity in property/support terms, we’ll include the simplest form that satisfies the requirement.</div></details>
<details><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">They’re included in your $5,000 plan for a standard uncontested case. If the court requires something unusual, we quote before spending.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Often yes. We’ll use court‑accepted electronic signatures and RON where allowed.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">We’ll sequence steps and file as early as allowed. Some timing is court‑driven; we’ll give you a realistic range.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we own property together?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">We’ll list major assets and debts with clear who‑gets‑what terms so clerks and agencies can process without questions.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if we separated years ago?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">That’s okay. We’ll confirm the grounds and reflect your current agreement.</div></details>
<details><summary>Will this affect immigration?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Divorce can affect certain applications. If immigration is a concern, we’ll coordinate timing and documentation with your immigration counsel.</div></details>
<details><summary>How do we start?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Click “Start your divorce” and complete the quick intake. We’ll reply with next steps and a draft engagement letter.</div></details>
<details><summary>Can things become contested mid‑way?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">If disagreements arise, we can pause and discuss options. The uncontested plan applies only to fully agreed matters.</div></details>
<details><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">No, not for uncontested cases. If you need help finalizing terms, we can refer you to neutral mediators.</div></details>
<details><summary>What if my spouse is in another state or country?</summary><div class="small" style="margin-top:8px">Service abroad or by alternative means is possible. If required, we’ll quote the extra cost up front before doing the work.</div></details>
