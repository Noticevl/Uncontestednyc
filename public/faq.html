    <h1 class="h1">Frequently asked questions</h1>
    <div class="faq">
      <details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><p class="small">Usually not in an uncontested divorce. We structure your file so it’s decided on papers whenever allowed.</p></details><details><summary>How long does this take?</summary><p class="small">Many uncontested matters finish in 8–16 weeks after signatures, depending on the borough’s workload.</p></details><details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><p class="small">Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard NYC filing fees, and routine personal service. If your case needs unusual steps (publication, international service, translation), we’ll explain them plainly and show the cost before you decide.</p></details><details><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><p class="small">Yes. Refunds are available before each stage begins: Stage 1 before drafting work; Stage 2 before filing/service; Stage 3 before judgment submissions are prepared.</p></details><details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><p class="small">No. New York’s residency statute offers multiple paths (e.g., one spouse in NY for two years; or one year with NY ties). We’ll map your facts to a qualifying path at intake.</p></details><details><summary>What counts as 'uncontested'?</summary><p class="small">Both spouses agree on all terms—property, parenting, support, and debt—and want the divorce granted.</p></details><details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><p class="small">The CSSA formula applies set percentages to combined income with caps and add‑ons. We run the math and include the required worksheets.</p></details><details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><p class="small">Yes—there are lawful ways to keep a residential address private in filings. We’ll advise on the option that applies.</p></details><details><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><p class="small">Yes. We can include a restoration of a former name in the Judgment so there’s one permanent court record.</p></details><details><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><p class="small">Not typically. Communication is through filings and orders unless the court directs otherwise.</p></details>
