  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
  <div class='accordion'>
<details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><p class='muted'>Most uncontested divorces are handled on paper without any in‑person appearance. If something unusual is needed, we’ll explain it early.</p></details>
<details><summary>How long does an uncontested case usually take?</summary><p class='muted'>Many matters finish 8–16 weeks after signatures, but timing varies by borough workload and clerk review queues. We give you a realistic range at onboarding.</p></details>
<details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><p class='muted'>Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard NYC filing fees, and routine personal service. If your case needs unusual steps (publication, international service, translations, certified mail abroad), we quote the outside cost and get your OK first.</p></details>
<details><summary>Are there refunds and when?</summary><p class='muted'>Yes. Stage‑based refunds: before drafting work; before filing occurs; and before judgment work begins. Once a stage’s work starts, that stage is earned.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><p class='muted'>Not necessarily. DRL §230 offers several residency paths—e.g., one spouse living in NY for two years, or one year with a NY marriage/grounds connection.</p></details>
<details><summary>What counts as 'uncontested'?</summary><p class='muted'>Both spouses must agree on all issues (property, support, and parenting if any) and be willing to sign. If disputes arise, we discuss options.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can we e‑file the case?</summary><p class='muted'>We use NYSCEF wherever accepted and EDDS when required. You’ll receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if we have children?</summary><p class='muted'>We’ll convert your agreement into court‑ready terms. Parenting must be workable: schedule, holidays, travel, decision‑making, and communication.</p></details>
<details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><p class='muted'>We run the CSSA formula using combined parental income and the number of children, apply caps and add‑ons, and include the required worksheets.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><p class='muted'>Yes. We can use a mail agent, redact documents, and follow safe‑address practices for filings.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><p class='muted'>Yes—if requested, the Judgment restores your prior name so you can update IDs in one pass.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</summary><p class='muted'>We can serve out of state or abroad using methods permitted by CPLR and treaties; we’ll advise on the simplest path.</p></details>
<details><summary>What happens if things become contested?</summary><p class='muted'>We’ll flag the point where the matter no longer fits an uncontested track and discuss options before you spend more.</p></details>
<details><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><p class='muted'>No. Some couples use mediators, but uncontested divorces can proceed with counsel and a settlement agreement.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><p class='muted'>No—state residency is enough under DRL §230. We’ll map your facts to a qualifying path.</p></details>
<details><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><p class='muted'>Direct calls from judges are rare in uncontested matters. We monitor your case and respond to clerk requests as needed.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><p class='muted'>New York permits remote online notarization (RON) with approved platforms. We’ll advise where it’s accepted.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</summary><p class='muted'>Yes. We write in plain English and include custom terms so the plan is workable for your family.</p></details>
<details><summary>What about retirement accounts?</summary><p class='muted'>We use clear language for division of retirement assets and can prepare QDRO instructions if needed (outside vendors may charge fees).</p></details>
<details><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><p class='muted'>Uncontested cases generally rely on sworn statements and exchanged documents rather than formal discovery.</p></details>
<details><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><p class='muted'>Standard court fees are included in the $5,000 all‑in plan. Any unusual costs are quoted in advance.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><p class='muted'>Many signatures can be done electronically; notarized documents can often be handled via RON.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><p class='muted'>We’ll sequence drafting and filings to hit your timeline when the court allows. We also keep you posted on review queues.</p></details>
<details><summary>What if we already separated years ago?</summary><p class='muted'>That’s fine. We’ll document the separation date in the stipulation and finalize the divorce on current terms.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do we start?</summary><p class='muted'>Click “Start your divorce” to send your details. We’ll reply with next steps and a secure link to upload documents.</p></details>
