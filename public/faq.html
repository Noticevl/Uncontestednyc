  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
  <div class="accordion">
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Do I have to appear in court?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>In typical NYC uncontested matters, no personal appearance is required. We structure your papers so the clerk and judge can review and sign without a hearing.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">How long does an uncontested divorce take?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>After both spouses sign the final documents, many cases conclude in about 8–16 weeks depending on borough workload. We give you a realistic range during intake.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What exactly does the $5,000 include?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Attorney time from intake to judgment; standard NYC filing fees (Index Number and Note of Issue equivalents); and routine personal service. If your case requires unusual steps such as publication, international service, or translation, we quote the out‑of‑pocket cost before you decide.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Are there refunds?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Yes. This practice uses staged work with refunds available before each stage begins: (1) before drafting starts; (2) before filing/service occurs; and (3) before judgment submissions are prepared.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Do we need a settlement agreement?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>If you have property, parenting, or support terms, we capture them in a simple, enforceable agreement or stipulation so the Judgment reflects what you intend.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What counts as “uncontested”?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Both spouses agree on all issues and are willing to sign. If a dispute arises mid‑process, we can pause, outline options, and quote any additional work before proceeding.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Do both of us have to live in New York?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Not necessarily. New York’s residency statute allows several paths—e.g., one spouse living in NY for two continuous years; or one year with NY ties such as the marriage taking place here or the cause arising here.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Can we e‑file the entire case?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We use NYSCEF wherever accepted and EDDS where directed. You receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">How is child support calculated?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>The CSSA applies a percentage to combined parental income, then considers add‑ons (child care, health care). We run the math with current caps and include the required worksheets.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What if we have children?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We write a clear parenting plan—residence, parenting schedule, holidays, travel, decision‑making, and communication—so it’s workable and passes clerk review.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Can I keep my home address private?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>If safety or privacy is a concern, we discuss options such as an attorney address for service or sealing specific details consistent with court rules.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Can I restore my former name?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Yes. We include restoration in the pleadings so your Judgment becomes the one permanent document you’ll use with agencies and institutions.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We’ll handle lawful service (including international service where required) and explain any extra costs in advance.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">How do notarizations work?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We support in‑person notarization or Remote Online Notarization (RON) where permitted by New York guidance. We send crystal‑clear signing instructions.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What if things become contested mid‑way?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We can pause and discuss options. If the scope changes, we’ll outline a path and quote additional work before you decide whether to proceed.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Is mediation required?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>No. Many couples reach terms directly. If you’d like mediation, we can share neutral‑mediator options; we remain your filing counsel.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Will a judge ever call me?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Unlikely in standard uncontested matters. Most communication is through filings and written decisions.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Do I need to be a NYC resident?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>No. The residency statute focuses on New York State (with certain NYC‑specific filing practices). We confirm eligibility at intake.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What are the filing fees?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Standard fees are included in the flat $5,000 price. Any unusual out‑of‑pocket costs (publication, international courier) are quoted in advance.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">How do we start?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Click “Start your divorce now,” complete the brief intake, and we’ll send the engagement letter and next‑step checklist the same day.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Can we sign everything electronically?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Yes—most documents can be signed electronically, with notarizations performed in ink or via RON when allowed.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What if we own property together?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>We list major assets and debts, specify who keeps what, and explain how transfers and payoffs will be handled to avoid post‑judgment issues.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">What if we already separated years ago?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>That’s common. We’ll document the separation date and ensure the agreement reflects current circumstances.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Will this affect immigration?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Divorce can have downstream effects. We recommend speaking with an immigration attorney if status relies on marriage; we can coordinate timing.</p></div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="acc-item">
      <button class="acc-btn">Can I get a certified copy of the Judgment?</button>
      <div class="acc-panel"><p>Yes. We’ll help you request certified copies if you need them for agencies, name change, or records.</p></div>
