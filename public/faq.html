<div class='accordion'>
  <details open><summary>What exactly counts as “uncontested”?</summary><div>An uncontested divorce means there are no disagreements about property division, spousal support, parenting time/custody, and child support; and the other spouse either signs the documents or does not appear after proper service. See the court’s overview of uncontested divorces for the self‑help definition and forms.</div></details>
  <details><summary>How do I know if I meet the residency requirement?</summary><div>Under DRL §230, you meet residency if either spouse has lived in NY for two years immediately before filing, or for one year coupled with a New York tie, such as marrying in NY, living in NY as spouses, or having grounds in NY. We verify the facts and select the correct DRL §230 paragraph in your pleadings.</div></details>
  <details><summary>Which grounds do you use, and why?</summary><div>In nearly all uncontested cases we use DRL §170(7), “irretrievable breakdown” for at least six months. It avoids proving fault and keeps the focus on paperwork accuracy and timing.</div></details>
  <details><summary>Do I need to go to court?</summary><div>Most uncontested divorces are decided on papers. Occasionally, a judge may request a clarification or conference. We handle the correspondence and prepare you if needed.</div></details>
  <details><summary>How are documents filed?</summary><div>We e‑file through NYSCEF where permitted (matrimonial e‑filing is generally by consent; see 22 NYCRR 202.16‑c). If not available, we use EDDS or paper filing per the county’s instruction. Note EDDS submissions are “filed” only when the clerk accepts them.</div></details>
  <details><summary>What are the court fees? Are they included?</summary><div>Statewide civil fees include the Index Number ($210), RJI ($95), and Note of Issue ($30 where a prior RJI has been paid). In New York County, uncontested matrimonial cases also carry a $125 calendar fee. Your flat fee includes these standard items.</div></details>
  <details><summary>What if we have kids?</summary><div>We include CSSA‑compliant child support language (or a valid opt‑out with required explanations) and clear parenting provisions. Some counties require UCS‑111 child support summary forms. We’ll advise what your judge expects.</div></details>
  <details><summary>How is the other spouse notified?</summary><div>By personal delivery (CPLR 308) unless alternate service is ordered by the court. We coordinate service and ensure proofs are in order.</div></details>
  <details><summary>Can the Judgment restore a prior surname?</summary><div>Yes. DRL §240‑a provides that the divorce Judgment may authorize either spouse to resume a premarriage surname or any former surname. We include the clause if you want it.</div></details>
  <details><summary>Can court fees be waived due to hardship?</summary><div>Possibly. Courts can waive fees on motion for poor person relief under CPLR 1101. We’ll discuss if this is appropriate and how to apply.</div></details>
  <details><summary>How long will this take?</summary><div>Court‑dependent. Many uncontested cases finalize within a few months after filing the signed packet, but specific calendars vary by borough and workload. We file promptly and respond fast to any inquiries.</div></details>
