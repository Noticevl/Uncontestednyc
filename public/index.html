  <section class='section' id='faq'><div class='container'><h2 class='h2'>Frequently asked questions</h2><div class='faq-grid'><details class='faq'><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Not usually. Uncontested divorces in NYC are mostly paperwork-driven. If your filings are in order and the clerk has no issues, there is typically no in-person appearance.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How long does an uncontested divorce take in NYC?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>A few months is common once all signatures are complete and service is done. Timing varies by county workload and whether corrections are needed.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What exactly is included in the $5,000 flat fee?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Attorney time, standard NYC filing fees, and routine personal service within the five boroughs for a straightforward uncontested matter. If anything unusual is needed—translation, international service, or publication—we’ll quote that in writing before work begins.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Is the fee refundable?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—before work is rendered at each stage. The engagement letter breaks the matter into three stages (Intake & Drafting, Filing & Service, Judgment & Closeout) and you may request a refund before the next stage starts.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can you file via NYSCEF?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes. Where available, we use NYSCEF for Supreme Court e‑filing; otherwise we route through EDDS or clerk-preferred channels.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do both spouses need New York residency?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>No. New York has multiple residency paths (e.g., one spouse living in NY for two years; or one year when the marriage occurred in NY or grounds occurred in NY). We’ll confirm the best route for your facts.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>It can still be uncontested as long as you agree on custody, parenting time, and child support. Your agreement must include the CSSA recitals and any deviation reasons so the clerk can accept it.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>If you’ve already agreed on everything, a signed and properly acknowledged settlement agreement keeps the case smooth. Some couples proceed with a detailed stipulation of settlement instead—either way the notary acknowledgment must be correct.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Under the CSSA, the basic obligation is a percentage of combined parental income up to the statutory cap, divided pro‑rata. Your agreement must include the required notices and any deviation statement.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Will I get a certified copy of the Judgment?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes. After entry, you can request certified copies from the county clerk for agencies, benefits, or name‑change updates.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can you help if my spouse is out of state?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Often yes. If they’ll sign an acknowledgment, we may avoid formal service. If not, we’ll coordinate compliant service where they live or seek court permission for an alternative.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can I keep my home address private on public filings?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We can discuss confidentiality tools (e.g., omission of apartment number where rules allow and use of safe contact info). We’ll follow local rules and clerk preferences.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you handle contested issues?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>This practice is focused on uncontested matters. If disputes arise, we can discuss options: limited‑scope review, mediation referral, or litigation counsel.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What are the typical court fees?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Your flat fee covers standard NYC filing fees (index number, note of issue where applicable) under this plan. Extraordinary fees are quoted only if needed.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can we change our names as part of the divorce?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—name restoration can be included and reflected in the Judgment so agencies can update records.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you work in all five boroughs?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. We tailor filings to each clerk’s preferences.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How do we sign documents?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We’ll provide clear instructions for notarization. Remote online notarization (RON) may be available through approved providers if appropriate.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if we can’t find the marriage certificate?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You can order a replacement from the issuing jurisdiction. We’ll point you to the correct office and what details you need to request it.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can I do parts of this myself?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—some clients ask us to review drafts or file only. The flat fee is for full service; we can discuss limited‑scope options if you prefer.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>When is the divorce final?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>When the signed Judgment is entered by the clerk. We’ll let you know as soon as it’s recorded and how to get certified copies.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Will the court reject my paperwork?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Clerks can require corrections if forms or acknowledgments are off. Our goal is to prevent that with checklists and locally tuned templates.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How do we prove service?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Either through an Affidavit of Defendant (they acknowledge service and consent) or a sworn Affidavit of Service from a process server if formal service is used.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can we e‑file everything the same way in every borough?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Not exactly. Acceptance differs across counties and by document type. We follow the local guidance for NYSCEF and EDDS to avoid delays.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if my spouse is on active duty?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Special protections may apply. We’ll walk through SCRA considerations and any consent/appearance needs for an uncontested case.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you offer a quick consult?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—free 15‑minute fit call to confirm eligibility and the path forward.</div></details></div></div></section>
