    <h2 class="h2">FAQ</h2>
    <div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What is an uncontested divorce in New York?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">An uncontested divorce is one where both spouses agree to end the marriage and agree on all required issues—property division, debt allocation, child custody/parenting time, child support, and (if applicable) spousal support. Because there are no disputes for a judge to decide, the case proceeds on papers instead of courtroom hearings. The court must still review and approve your agreement and the proposed judgment.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Do I need to appear in court?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">In a typical NYC uncontested divorce, there are no in‑person court appearances. All documents are filed through NYSCEF (where available) or delivered through the clerk, and the judge reviews your papers in chambers. If something is missing or unclear, we address it by supplemental filings—not a hearing.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How long does an uncontested divorce take in NYC?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Timeframes vary by county and judicial part. Once both spouses sign the documents, many matters finalize in 8–16 weeks. Delays usually come from missing forms, service issues, or heavy court calendars. I set realistic expectations and keep you informed as the clerk’s office and judge move the file.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What does the flat fee cover?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">The $5,000 flat fee covers attorney time to evaluate eligibility; draft and review the settlement documents and uncontested divorce packet; coordinate service; file through NYSCEF or EDDS when applicable; cure defects the clerk flags; and monitor the case through entry of Judgment of Divorce. The plan also includes the standard New York filing fees and routine personal service within NYC. Edge cases—translation, out‑of‑state service, publication, extensive revisions—are priced as add‑ons only if needed.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Are court costs really included?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes—typical NYC filing fees are included in the flat fee. If a case requires unusual costs (e.g., publication, international service, certified translations), we’ll confirm them in writing before any spend. The goal is zero surprises.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What if we don’t have a signed settlement yet?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">That’s fine. I can draft a plain‑English settlement agreement or stipulation that memorializes the terms you already agree on. We’ll focus on clarity and enforceability without unnecessary complexity.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What if we start uncontested but a dispute pops up?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">If disagreements arise—say about parenting time or finances—we’ll pause and reassess. I can recommend next steps (mediation, limited‑scope negotiation, or, if truly necessary, contested counsel). You only pay the flat fee if the matter remains uncontested.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How is service of process handled?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">New York requires personal service of the Summons on the defendant by a non‑party adult; within NYC we coordinate routine personal service. If a spouse is cooperative, we can often use an affidavit of defendant instead of formal service. When service is challenging, we’ll plan alternatives consistent with CPLR and local rules.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Will a judge review our agreement?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes. The court reviews your proposed Judgment, settlement, and required affidavits to confirm they comply with New York law and protect the best interests of any children. If provisions are unclear or incomplete, the clerk or court may request corrections. I build to court‑ready from the start to avoid that.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can we keep our parenting schedule flexible?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Absolutely. Courts accept customized schedules if they are specific enough to be enforceable and protect the children’s best interests. Many parents use a baseline schedule with agreed flexibility language. I’ll propose language that avoids ambiguity while giving you room to adapt.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How does child support work?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">The Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) sets a formula based on combined parental income and the number of children, with adjustments for health insurance, childcare, and add‑ons. You can deviate from the formula if you both agree and the court finds the result fair. I provide a worksheet so you understand the default and any negotiated alternative.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What about spousal support (maintenance)?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">New York has advisory guidelines based on income and certain caps. Many uncontested divorces use a short‑term or waived maintenance depending on circumstances. If you’re considering maintenance, I’ll run the calculator and translate the impact into plain English.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Do we need to split retirement accounts now?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">If retirement assets are part of the settlement, we usually reference them in the agreement and then finalize transfers with a QDRO (for certain plans) after Judgment. I’ll flag when a QDRO specialist is prudent to ensure the plan accepts the order.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can we keep the apartment/house while we sell or refinance?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes. Many agreements set an interim plan—who lives there, who pays carrying costs, timelines to list or refinance, and how net proceeds are divided. Specifics prevent later disputes.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can I restore a former name?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes. You can ask the court to restore a prior surname in the Judgment of Divorce. I include the appropriate clause so your identification updates are straightforward.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What are the most common reasons papers get rejected?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Missing signatures, inconsistent dates, unclear parenting provisions, incorrect service windows, and not attaching required forms (especially in child‑related matters). My process includes a defect‑check pass before filing.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Will the divorce affect immigration status?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Divorce can interact with certain immigration benefits. I don’t provide immigration advice, but I’ll flag issues and recommend consulting an immigration attorney when needed.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can we file if a spouse lives outside New York?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes, depending on New York’s residency requirements. Many cases proceed when one spouse meets the residency rule. We’ll confirm eligibility in the consult.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Do we need notarization?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes. Many documents must be notarized. I’m set up for remote online notarization (RON) where permissible, or we can arrange convenient in‑person notarization.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">What if we have overseas documents?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">If documents originate abroad, the court may require apostilles or certified translations. We’ll identify those early to avoid delay.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can I get copies of everything?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Of course. You’ll have a secure, organized folder with final, signed PDFs and important dates. Transparency is the point.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How do refunds work?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">You can request a refund at any stage before work is performed for that stage. The engagement letter spells out the three‑stage billing so you always know what has been earned and what remains refundable.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Do you offer payment plans?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">The philosophy is simplicity and certainty. The flat fee is staged (intake/drafting, filing/service, judgment). If you need a short schedule within those stages, we can discuss one that doesn’t add surprise cost.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Are you licensed in New York?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">Yes—licensed in New York and Washington, D.C. The practice is focused on NYC uncontested divorces.</p></div>
    </div><div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Is this site secure?</div>
      <div class="faq-a"><p class="p">We take basic security seriously (encrypted hosting and modern best practices). Still, email is not a secure channel. Avoid sending sensitive details until you’re a client and we’ve set up an appropriate method.</p></div>
