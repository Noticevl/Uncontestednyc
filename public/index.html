  <h2>NYC Divorce Hub</h2>
  <p class="muted">This library explains the uncontested process in NYC without legal jargon. Open a topic below to read in place.</p>
  <div class="hub-tiles">
    <div class="tile"><h3>Eligibility</h3><p class="muted">New York offers several residency paths. Common examples include one spouse living in NY for two continuous years before filing; or one spouse living in NY for one year with the marriage taking place here or the cause arising here. We’ll map your facts to a qualifying path and confirm documentation at intake.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Timeline</h3><p class="muted">For uncontested cases, a typical flow is: intake → drafting → signatures → filing → clerk review → Judgment. Many matters complete in 8–16 weeks after signatures, but timing varies by borough workload. You’ll see a realistic range the day we onboard you.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Cost</h3><p class="muted">Your flat $5,000 includes attorney time, standard NYC filing fees, and routine local service. If your case needs outside steps (Hague service, publication, translation), we’ll show the out‑of‑pocket amount before you choose it—no surprises.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Forms</h3><p class="muted">You’ll see only what’s needed: Summons with Notice or Verified Complaint, Sworn Statements, Affidavit of Defendant or default stack, Note of Issue equivalents, Child Support forms if applicable, and the proposed Judgment. We organize each packet so clerks can approve it without back‑and‑forth.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Service</h3><p class="muted">When both spouses cooperate, we use the simplest lawful service. Otherwise we follow CPLR/DRL-compliant personal service, or court‑approved alternatives if necessary.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>E‑filing</h3><p class="muted">We use NYSCEF wherever accepted and EDDS where directed. You’ll receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Parenting & custody</h3><p class="muted">If you have children, your plan must be workable. We write plainly: where the child lives, parenting time schedule, holidays, travel, decision‑making, and how you’ll communicate about the child.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Child support</h3><p class="muted">The CSSA formula starts with combined parental income and applies percentages based on the number of children. We’ll run the math with current caps and add‑ons, and include the worksheets required for review.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Property & debt</h3><p class="muted">List the major items (home, retirement, car, credit cards) and write simple terms for who keeps what and how to transfer or pay. Clear dates = fewer questions from clerks.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Name change</h3><p class="muted">If you’d like a former name restored, we place it in the pleadings and the Judgment so you have a single, permanent document.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>After the divorce</h3><p class="muted">Close the loop: update beneficiaries, titles, and accounts; handle QDROs if needed; download your final documents for your records.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Common mistakes</h3><p class="muted">Vague parenting terms, missing service proof, unreadable scans, and skipping required forms. We prevent these with checklists and two rounds of review.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Checklists</h3><p class="muted">We provide printable checklists for documents, signing, and post‑judgment tasks. Use them to keep everyone on track.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Glossary</h3><p class="muted">Plain‑English explanations of common terms so you never have to guess what something means.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Borough guides</h3><p class="muted">Each borough’s Supreme Court has preferences. We keep notes on filing windows, clerk quirks, and the smoothest channels to get your case approved.</p></div>
<div class="tile"><h3>Free resources</h3><p class="muted">Links to NYSCEF, EDDS, NYC Clerk pages, child support calculators, mediation resources, and legal aid information.</p></div>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-grid">
    <details><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><p class="muted">Most uncontested NYC divorces are completed entirely on paper. In rare situations a brief appearance may be requested—usually when a judge wants clarification about a term. If that happens, I’ll prepare you for the exact questions you might get.</p></details><details><summary>How long does it take?</summary><p class="muted">A common range is 8–16 weeks from signing, depending on borough review times. The schedule is driven by how quickly you return questionnaires, whether service is straightforward, and the court’s queue. I’ll give you a borough‑specific estimate at intake and update you if timing shifts.</p></details><details><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><p class="muted">Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard NYC filing fees (Index Number and Note of Issue equivalents), routine personal service in NYC, and two rounds of document revisions. If your case needs unusual steps (publication, international service, translation, certified mail abroad), I’ll show those outside costs up front and get your okay before we spend anything.</p></details><details><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><p class="muted">Yes. This practice uses staged work with refunds available before each stage begins. Stage 1 refund before drafting starts; Stage 2 refund before filing/service occurs; Stage 3 refund before judgment submissions are prepared. If work has begun in a stage, we credit any unused portion back to you.</p></details><details><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><p class="muted">Not necessarily. New York’s residency statute allows several paths. Examples: one spouse lived in NY for a continuous year before filing and the marriage took place here; or either spouse has lived in NY for two continuous years. I’ll map your facts to a qualifying path at intake.</p></details><details><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><p class="muted">You and your spouse agree on everything—grounds (irretrievable breakdown), property/debt division, and, if applicable, parenting and child support. If a new dispute pops up mid‑process, we’ll pause and discuss options: limited-scope help to resolve it, or referral to contested counsel.</p></details><details><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><p class="muted">In most NYC Supreme Courts, yes—NYSCef accepts uncontested filings. If clerks ask for something by EDDS or paper, we follow their instruction; the goal is to pass review the first time.</p></details><details><summary>What if we have children?</summary><p class="muted">Uncontested still works if you’ve agreed on custody, parenting time, and child support. We’ll draft those terms clearly so a clerk and judge can confirm they’re workable and in the child’s best interests.</p></details><details><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><p class="muted">New York’s Child Support Standards Act (CSSA) uses a formula based on combined parental income, caps that change periodically, and adjustments for health insurance, childcare, and add‑ons. I’ll run the numbers with you and attach the required worksheets.</p></details><details><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><p class="muted">Yes—New York allows a mailing address that’s different from a residence and, in appropriate circumstances, confidentiality measures. If privacy or safety is a concern, tell me immediately and we’ll pick the right option.</p></details><details><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><p class="muted">Yes. If you want it in the Judgment, we include it in the pleadings so there’s no second trip later.</p></details><details><summary>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</summary><p class="muted">Service gets a little more formal, but it’s manageable. Options include personal service where they live, service through the Hague Convention (if applicable), or publication if they cannot be located despite a diligent search.</p></details><details><summary>What happens if something becomes contested mid‑way?</summary><p class="muted">We’ll stop before filing work in the next stage. I can either provide limited help to try to resolve the issue or refer you to contested counsel. You won’t be billed for work we didn’t perform.</p></details><details><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><p class="muted">If you’ve already signed one, I’ll review it for clarity and compliance. If not, we’ll draft a simple, plain‑English agreement that matches your deal and meets clerk expectations.</p></details><details><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><p class="muted">No. Many couples reach agreement on their own. If you’d benefit from a neutral, I can recommend vetted NYC mediators who work quickly and practically.</p></details><details><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><p class="muted">You need to meet a New York residency path. Living in the city helps with logistics (service, notarization), but the statute is statewide.</p></details><details><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><p class="muted">Very rarely. Most communication is through clerk notes. I keep you posted if anything is requested.</p></details><details><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><p class="muted">We can use traditional notarization or remote online notarization (RON) where permitted. I’ll provide precise instructions for each document.</p></details><details><summary>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</summary><p class="muted">Yes—as long as they’re workable and in the child’s best interests. I’ll flag anything that might raise clerk questions and help you rewrite it so it passes review.</p></details><details><summary>What about retirement accounts?</summary><p class="muted">For uncontested matters we use straightforward terms or a QDRO if needed. If a QDRO is required, I coordinate with a specialist so it’s prepared correctly.</p></details><details><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><p class="muted">Uncontested cases still require basic affidavits and, when support is involved, income information. I’ll tell you exactly what to gather and what the court actually reads.</p></details><details><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><p class="muted">Standard NYC filing fees are included in the $5,000 flat fee. If a clerk requires an extra certification (rare), I’ll get your approval first.</p></details><details><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><p class="muted">Many documents can be e‑signed and RON‑notarized. A few may require a wet signature; I’ll tell you which and provide prepaid labels if mailing is easiest.</p></details><details><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><p class="muted">We can structure the file for speed—complete, legible, clerk‑friendly, and submitted through the right channel. I’ll be honest about realistic timelines in your borough.</p></details><details><summary>What if we own property together?</summary><p class="muted">We’ll include clear terms for refinance, sale, or buy‑out, with dates that make sense. Simpler is faster.</p></details><details><summary>What if we already separated years ago?</summary><p class="muted">That’s fine. We’ll confirm there are no open cases and that your agreement reflects your current reality. The legal grounds remain irretrievable breakdown.</p></details><details><summary>Will this affect immigration?</summary><p class="muted">Divorce can have immigration consequences. I don’t provide immigration advice, but I’ll coordinate with your immigration counsel or refer you to one if needed.</p></details><details><summary>How do we start?</summary><p class="muted">Send the short intake form. I’ll reply with a time for your consult and, if it’s a fit, an engagement letter that lists exactly what’s included.</p></details>
