<section class="section"><div class="container"><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><div class="faq-grid"><div class="faq-item"><button>Do I have to appear in court?</button><div class="a"><p>Usually no. NYC uncontested divorces are primarily paperwork. We handle drafting, e‑filing, and judgment submissions. If a short appearance becomes necessary, we’ll explain why and prepare you.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>How long does this take?</button><div class="a"><p>A typical path is intake → drafting → signatures → filing → clerk review → Judgment. Many matters complete in 8–16 weeks after signatures; borough review times vary.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</button><div class="a"><p>Attorney time from intake to Judgment; standard NYC fees (Index Number and Note of Issue equivalents); routine personal service; two rounds of revisions; filing and tracking.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Are there refunds?</button><div class="a"><p>Yes. Staged refunds before work begins in Stage 1, before filing in Stage 2, and before judgment submissions in Stage 3. If work has started in a stage, we’ll deduct completed work at a transparent rate.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Do both of us have to live in New York?</button><div class="a"><p>Not necessarily. New York’s residency statute offers several paths—for example, one spouse having lived in NY for two continuous years; or one year with the marriage taking place here or the cause arising here. We map your facts to a qualifying path at intake.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What counts as “uncontested”?</button><div class="a"><p>You’ve reached 100% agreement on the terms—property, debt, parenting, and support. If disputes remain, we’ll suggest resources and, if needed, a referral.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Can we e‑file?</button><div class="a"><p>We use NYSCEF whenever accepted and EDDS when directed. You’ll receive confirmations and a tidy record of everything submitted.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What if we have children?</button><div class="a"><p>Your parenting plan must be clear and workable. We’ll capture where the child lives, the parenting time schedule, decision‑making, travel/holiday terms, and communication norms.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>How is child support calculated?</button><div class="a"><p>NY follows the CSSA. The formula applies a percentage to combined parental income based on the number of children, with add‑ons for childcare, unreimbursed health costs, and education. We’ll run current caps and add‑ons and include required worksheets.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Can I keep my home address private?</button><div class="a"><p>Yes—use a mailing address and avoid publishing your unit number. We’ll structure pleadings and service to protect privacy where permitted.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Can I restore my former name?</button><div class="a"><p>Yes. If you’d like a former name restored, we include it in the pleadings and the Judgment so you receive one, permanent court order.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</button><div class="a"><p>We’ll use the simplest lawful service: acceptance/waiver, CPLR‑compliant personal service, or court‑approved alternatives. For international locations, we discuss Hague Convention options or letters rogatory.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Is mediation required?</button><div class="a"><p>No, but it can help finalize terms before filing. If you need a neutral, we can refer reputable NYC mediators.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</button><div class="a"><p>No—residency is statewide. We’ll evaluate your facts under the statute at intake.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Will a judge ever call me?</button><div class="a"><p>Rarely. Most communication is through the e‑filed record and written decisions.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>How do notarizations work?</button><div class="a"><p>We can coordinate remote online notarization or in‑person notarization to keep things moving.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</button><div class="a"><p>Yes—so long as the terms are clear and workable. We write in plain English and ensure they meet court expectations.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Do we need financial disclosures?</button><div class="a"><p>For uncontested cases, disclosures are streamlined. If a judge requests additional detail, we’ll prepare it.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What are the filing fees?</button><div class="a"><p>Your plan includes standard NYC filing fees. If a court orders publication or special process‑server work, we’ll show that outside cost before proceeding.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Can I sign everything electronically?</button><div class="a"><p>Most signatures can be electronic; some notarized documents may need in‑person or RON procedures depending on the form and county practice.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What if I need my Judgment fast?</button><div class="a"><p>We can sequence drafting and signatures quickly; final timing still depends on county review speed. We’ll give you a realistic range at onboarding.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>What if we own property together?</button><div class="a"><p>We’ll spell out property and debt terms clearly—who keeps what, how to transfer title, and any buyout timelines—so clerks don’t kick it back for vagueness.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>Will this affect immigration?</button><div class="a"><p>Divorce can affect certain immigration benefits. We’ll suggest you consult an immigration attorney if relevant.</p></div></div><div class="faq-item"><button>How do we start?</button><div class="a"><p>Use the contact form or call. We’ll confirm eligibility, send the engagement letter, and begin Stage 1.</p></div></div></div></div></section>
