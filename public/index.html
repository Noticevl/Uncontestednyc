    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
<details class="item"><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class="body"><p>Usually no for straightforward uncontested matters. Most are completed through e‑filing and mail with no in‑person appearance.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>How long does it take?</summary><div class="body"><p>Many cases complete in 8–16 weeks after signatures and filing, subject to the borough’s review timelines.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div class="body"><p>Attorney time from intake to Judgment, standard NYC filing fees, and routine local service. Any non‑routine costs are shown up front for approval.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div class="body"><p>Yes. Staged refunds: Stage 1 before drafting starts; Stage 2 before filing/service; Stage 3 before judgment work begins.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><div class="body"><p>No. New York’s residency statute offers several qualifying paths. We’ll map your facts to one at intake.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><div class="body"><p>Both spouses agree on all divorce terms and neither plans to file responses contesting relief.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div class="body"><p>We use NYSCEF wherever permitted and EDDS when directed.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class="body"><p>We draft clear parenting terms—residence, time schedule, holidays, travel, decision‑making, and communication.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class="body"><p>New York applies the CSSA formula to combined income with statutory percentages and caps. We run the worksheet with current figures.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div class="body"><p>Yes. We can use a safe mailing address and keep your apartment number off public papers where possible.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div class="body"><p>Yes—add it now so Judgment restores it automatically.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What if my spouse lives out of state or country?</summary><div class="body"><p>We’ll use lawful service for that location; if publication is required, we’ll show the extra cost before proceeding.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><div class="body"><p>Many couples do; some use affidavits and proposed Judgment terms. We’ll suggest the simplest compliant path.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Is mediation required?</summary><div class="body"><p>No, not for uncontested filings. If you need help finishing terms, we can pause for mediation and resume.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Do I need to be a NYC resident?</summary><div class="body"><p>Not strictly—see residency paths. NYC filing venue is based on residence or where marriage occurred.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Will a judge ever call me?</summary><div class="body"><p>Rarely. Most communication is via clerk review notes we handle for you.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>How do notarizations work?</summary><div class="body"><p>In‑person notaries or NY‑compliant remote online notarization (RON) when eligible.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Can we include custom parenting provisions?</summary><div class="body"><p>Yes—so long as they’re workable and child‑focused. We translate goals into clear, enforceable terms.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Do we need financial disclosures?</summary><div class="body"><p>Basic income info supports child support; full discovery is generally unnecessary in uncontested cases.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What are the filing fees?</summary><div class="body"><p>Included in the $5,000 plan: Index Number and Note of Issue equivalents. Other rare fees are discussed up front.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>Can I sign everything electronically?</summary><div class="body"><p>We use e‑sign for drafts and affidavits when acceptable; wet ink is used where the court requires.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What if I need my Judgment fast?</summary><div class="body"><p>We sequence drafting and filing quickly; actual clerk timing is borough‑dependent.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What if we own property together?</summary><div class="body"><p>We’ll make the terms concrete about who keeps what and how transfers occur.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>What if we already separated years ago?</summary><div class="body"><p>That’s fine—uncontested is still possible if you both agree now.</p></div></details>
<details class="item"><summary>How do we start?</summary><div class="body"><p>Click “Start Your Intake” for a short form. You’ll get next steps and a document checklist.</p></div></details>
