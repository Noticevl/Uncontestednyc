<section class='section' id='faq'><div class='container'><h2 class='h2'>Frequently asked questions</h2><div class='faq-grid'><details class='faq'><summary>Do I have to appear in court?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Usually no. Most NYC uncontested divorces are handled by the clerk after your papers are signed and filed. If anything changes, we’ll tell you beforehand.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How long does this take?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>A few months is common once papers are signed and service is complete. The timeline depends on your borough’s clerk queue and how quickly signatures happen.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What exactly does the $5,000 include?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Attorney time, standard NYC filing fees, and routine personal service within the five boroughs. If your case needs something unusual—like translation, publication, or international service—we’ll explain the cost up front before you decide.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Are there refunds?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—before work is done in each stage: (1) Intake & Drafting, (2) Filing & Service, (3) Judgment & Closeout. We keep this in writing so there’s no guessing.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What counts as “uncontested”?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You both agree to end the marriage and you agree on the terms (money, property, and—if you have kids—custody/support).</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do both of us have to live in New York?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>No. New York has several residency routes. Often one spouse living in NY for the last two years works; one year may work if there are other NY connections (like marrying here).</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can we e‑file?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes. Many filings go through NYSCEF; some documents still use EDDS. We handle the submissions and keep PDFs neat so fixes are fast if the clerk asks.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if we have children?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You can still do an uncontested divorce if you agree on custody, parenting time, and support. Your paperwork needs specific child‑support language—we add it so the clerk has what they need.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do we need a settlement agreement?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>It helps a lot. If you’ve agreed on everything, a signed, notarized agreement makes review smoother and avoids missing details.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How is child support calculated?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>New York uses a formula based on combined income (up to a cap) and divides it between parents by income share. If you choose a different amount, your agreement must explain why and confirm the guidelines were considered.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if my spouse lives in another state or country?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Often still fine. If they’ll sign an acknowledgment/consent, we can avoid formal service. If not, we use a process server; for international service we’ll follow the right treaty or method.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can I keep my home address private?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We use safe contact details, and we’ll discuss privacy options that fit your situation before filing.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if things become contested mid‑way?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We focus on uncontested matters. If disputes appear, we’ll discuss mediation or a hand‑off to litigation counsel so you’re not stuck.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can I restore my former name?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes. We can include it in the Judgment so Social Security, DMV, and banks can update records without a separate case.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you work in all five boroughs?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. Each has small quirks we plan for.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How do we sign?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You can sign before a notary in person or through approved remote notarization when appropriate. We’ll prep the notary pages so it’s straightforward.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if I lost the marriage certificate?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You can order a replacement from the issuing office. We’ll point you to the right place and what to ask for.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can I do part of this myself?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>You can, but the flat fee is for full service. If you want limited help only, we can discuss a narrower scope so you pay for exactly what you want.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>When is the divorce final?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>When the Judgment of Divorce is signed and entered by the clerk. We’ll confirm entry and provide next steps for updates with agencies.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Why do courts reject papers?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Common reasons: missing notary language, inconsistent names/dates, or incomplete child‑support recitals. We use NYC‑specific checklists to prevent those hiccups.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How do we prove service?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Either your spouse signs an acknowledgment/consent or we use a process server who files an affidavit of service.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Is e‑filing the same in every borough?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Not exactly. Each county has preferences. We align with current practice so filings aren’t bounced back for format issues.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if my spouse is on active duty?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Special protections can apply. We’ll check what’s needed for an uncontested path and handle the language accordingly.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you offer a quick consult?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes—free 15‑minute fit call to confirm eligibility and timing.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What happens after the divorce?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We’ll send a practical list: certified copies, bank/benefit updates, name changes, and how to fix clerical errors if any appear.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can we keep our own parenting plan?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes, if it covers the basics. We’ll check for items the court expects (decision‑making, parenting time, support details).</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>How do we divide property and debt?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>List who keeps what and who pays which debts, with any deadlines. Clarity now prevents trouble later. For retirement accounts, you may need a special post‑judgment order; we’ll flag that early.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Can you work with my mediator’s draft?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes. We’ll review for court‑required language and align it with filing requirements.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>Do you meet clients in person?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>Yes, by appointment. We also work fully remote when convenient.</div></details><details class='faq'><summary>What if English isn’t our first language?</summary><div class='p' style='margin-top:8px'>We’ll talk about translation where needed and keep signatures clear so the clerk understands exactly what’s being signed.</div></details></div></div></section>
